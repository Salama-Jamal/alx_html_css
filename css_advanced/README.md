"README.md" is a file commonly found in software projects, particularly those hosted on platforms like GitHub. It stands for "read me" and is a text file that contains important information about the project, such as how to install and use the software, the project's purpose, and any other important details that users or contributors need to know. The ".md" extension indicates that the file is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that is commonly used for formatting text on the web.
